## VS Code Settings

If you're working on an existing project, its [Dev
Container](https://containers.dev/) should already have configured within the
rest of the necessary extensions. Look inside the `devcontainer.json` file in
the `customizations` section. Otherwise, create an issue in your project to add
them. Refer to [this
guide](https://github.com/ai-cfia/dev-rel-docs/blob/main/Development-Environment-Setup-Guide/DEV-ENV-SETUP.md#dev-containers-in-vs-code)
for the necessary extensions.

If you're creating a new project, follow [this
guide](https://github.com/ai-cfia/dev-rel-docs/blob/main/Development-Environment-Setup-Guide/DEV-ENV-SETUP.md#dev-containers-in-vs-code)
for details about what extensions to include in your Dev Container configuration
and more.
