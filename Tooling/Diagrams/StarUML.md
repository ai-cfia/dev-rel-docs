# StarUML

StarUML is a software for modeling that allows you to easily create UML
diagrams, entity-relationship, data flow diagrams, flowcharts, or mind-maps.

StarUML V1 is open source. However, it's no more maintained and cannot be
supported. Later versions, present 2 versions : "in evaluation mode, there will
be watermarks in the exported diagram images. There is no time limit for
evaluation, but it is only allowed for evaluation purpose. If you want to use
for other purposes including educational, personal, or commercial purpose, you
need to purchase licenses."

## Can we use StarUML ?

We **can't** use StarUML at the agency, please look into other options available
described in other wiki pages.
