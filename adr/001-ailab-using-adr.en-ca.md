# ADR-001: Adopting Architecture Decision Records

## Executive Summary

This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) establishes the use of ADRs within the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI-Lab) at Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) for documenting key architectural decisions. An ADR is a document
designed to capture decisions across multiple projects and products and are of
such significance that they require uniform compliance from all teams involved
([Ayers, 2019](#ref-ayers); [Henderson, n.d.](#ref-henderson)). We chose ADRs
for their version-controlled, clear, and accessible format, addressing issues
such as repeated discussions, inconsistent approaches, and difficulties in
onboarding new team members. The document sets the standards for ADR creation,
storage, and modification, and incorporates the Request for Comment (RFC)
process to enable collective deliberation and decision-making.

## Definitions

- Version Control: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over
  time so that specific versions can be recalled later, such as Git.
- Repository: A central location in which data, often version-controlled, is
  stored and managed.
- GitHub Issue: A feature on GitHub where project issues, enhancements, tasks,
  and other discussions are tracked.
- GitHub Pull Request: A mechanism for submitting contributions to an open
  development project hosted on GitHub.
- Wiki: A collaborative platform that allows for the editing of interlinked web
  pages, commonly used for documentation ([Lebar, 2022](#ref-lebar)).
- Request for Comment (RFC): A process that enables collective deliberation on a
  particular issue or proposed feature, often formalized and version-controlled
  ([Cal√ßado, 2018](#ref-calcado)).
- Confluence: A collaboration software program developed by Atlassian that
  functions as an enterprise wiki and project management tool ([Atlassian,
  n.d.](#ref-atlassian)).
- Decision Log: A record-keeping method that logs key decisions made throughout
  the course of a project, typically without version control ([Monday.com,
  n.d.](#ref-monday)).

## Context

AI-Lab, comprised of software developers and data scientists, is dedicated to
leveraging AI technologies to address a range of challenges, both within the
organization and in external engagements. As the team and its projects have
grown, challenges have arisen in maintaining a clear and understandable history
of architectural decisions. These challenges include:

- Repeated discussions about previously made decisions: The lack of a formalized
  decision-making process means that decisions are often revisited, causing
  wasted time and effort.
- Difficulty in onboarding new team members: The absence of a single, definitive
  source for architectural decisions complicates the onboarding process.
- Inconsistent architectural approaches: Different projects or project parts
  sometimes adopt varying approaches, leading to long-term maintainability
  issues.

## Decision

After evaluating various options, we chose to implement ADRs to maintain a
version-controlled and easily accessible record of important architectural
decisions. Each ADR will detail the reasoning, background, and consequences of
significant architectural choices, not trivial decisions.

#### Example of decisions that could be addressed by ADR

- Which database engine should we use and why?
- Should we move to a microservices architecture?
- What authentication strategy should we adopt?
- How will we handle API versioning?
- What approach will we take for caching?
- Which cloud provider should we use?
- What logging and monitoring solutions will be adopted?
- Should we use containers for deployment, and if so, which orchestration tool?
- Which message broker to use for asynchronous operations?
- What is our strategy for data backup and recovery?

#### Example of decisions that should not be addressed by ADR

- What color should the login button be?
- How do we implement a specific function in code?
- What are the specific firewall rules?
- What specific libraries to use for string manipulation?
- Which individual UI components to use?
- Setting up environment variables for local development.
- Pagination limits for lists and tables.
- Algorithm to use for a single, specific task.

### Format

- Language: ADRs should be written in English for uniformity and broader reach.
  French versions should be provided eventually.
- Clarity: Aim for straightforward and simple language in the ADRs.
- Proofreading: Review each ADR for linguistic and grammatical errors before
  finalizing. Tools like Antidote can be useful.
- File Naming: ADR files will be named using the format
  XXX-tag.language-code.md, where:
  - XXX is a three-digit number for ordering.
  - tag is a short, descriptive tag of the decision.
  - language-code follows the ISO 639-1 standard for language codes ([Library of
    Congress, 2017](#ref-library)). 
  
  Examples:
  - 001-ailab-using-adr.en-ca.md for the English (Canada) version.
  - 001-ailab-using-adr.fr-ca.md for the French (Canada) version.
- Attachments: Diagrams and other attachments will carry the original ADR's name
  prefix. For example, 001-ailab-using-adr-template.md.
- Title Format: Titles should start with "ADR-XXX: ", followed by a brief
  description. Numbers should match between the file name and title.
- Sections: An ADR will include Executive Summary, Context, Decision,
  Alternatives Considered, Consequences, and References ([Microsoft,
  2020](#ref-microsoft)). See [ADR Template](./001-ailab-using-adr-template.md)
  for more details.
- Referencing Format: Use APA style for formatting references ([American
  Psychological Association, n.d.](#ref-apa-examples)). In-text citations should
  be linked to the detailed citations in the References section.
    - Reference example: `<a id="ref-henderson"></a>Henderson, J. P. (n.d.).
      Architecture Decision Record (ADR)...`
    - Citation example: `([Henderson, n.d.](#ref-henderson))`

### Implicit Statuses

- PROPOSED: ADRs or modifications proposed via active GitHub pull requests and
  placed in the adr/ folder.
- ACCEPTED: ADRs merged in the main branch.
- REJECTED: GitHub pull requests that have been rejected or GitHub issues that
  led to a decision not to proceed.
- DEPRECATED: ADRs moved to the adr/archives/ folder, indicating the decision is
  void.
- SUPERSEDED: ADRs replaced by a new one and moved to adr/archives/, retaining
  their original tag but assigned a new number.
- MODIFIED: Minor changes to an existing ADR, retaining its original number and
  tag.

### Storage

- ADRs and theirs attachments will be stored in a dedicated directory within
  this [repository](https://github.com/ai-cfia/dev-rel-docs), under the folder
  adr/.
- Deprecated and superseded ADRs and their attachments will be moved to
  adr/archives/.

### Responsibilities, Creation and Update Process

- Proposals: Any member of the ai-cfia GitHub organization may initiate new ADRs
  or changes via GitHub issues and pull requests.
- Approval: All members of the ai-cfia GitHub organization must approve pull
  requests before merging.
- Manager Approval: The final step in the approval process is a review and
  approval from the team's manager.
- Disagreements: Any strong objections will pause the process until a consensus
  is reached.
- Communication: To foster wider collaboration and possibly offer useful
  insights, we invite upper management and other adjacent teams to participate
  in the ADR process by sharing our decisions with them.

#### Example: Superseding an ADR

1. Start by creating a GitHub issue to discuss the need for major changes in the
   existing ADR. Include all the team.
2. Once there's agreement, create a new branch for the changes.
   - In the new branch, create a new ADR with a new number but retain the
     original tag. This new ADR should reference the old one.
   - Update the old ADR to reference the new one and prepare it to be moved to
     adr/archives/.
   - Update the [index](./index.md).
   - Submit these changes as a pull request from the new branch, linking it to
     the original GitHub issue for context.
3. Once the pull request is approved by the whole team, merge it.

  subject tags and by consulting the version history for context.
- ADRs will serve as a point of reference for future architectural decisions,
  reducing the need for repeated discussions.
- This ADR will be reviewed periodically to assess its outcomes.
