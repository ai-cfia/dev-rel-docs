While it may not be perfect and might be too much focus on the transition when the document need to be focus on the final state, the structure can resemble the following:

# Title:
ADR on our choices of database structure

# Status:
Proposed

# Evaluation Criteria:
We aim to determine the most effective database structure that allows for seamless integration of multiple products, improves flexibility, maintainability, and fosters collaboration among development teams.

# Candidates to Consider:
We have considered various database structure options to accommodate multiple products, including maintaining the existing separate databases and our proposed restructuring approach.

# Research and Analysis of Each Candidate:
In our analysis, we thoroughly examined the existing "louis-db" and "nachet-db" structures and assessed the proposed restructuring. We found that the current isolated databases limited adaptability, while the proposed integrated approach promised improved efficiency and collaboration, similar to transitioning from separate drawers to a spacious wardrobe. The proposed changes would streamline maintenance, reduce errors, and support our growing product variety, making them the preferred choice for our database structure.

# Does/Doesn't Meet Criteria and Why:
The existing separate database approach doesn't meet our criteria as it leads to duplication, lacks flexibility, and hinders collaboration. The proposed changes meet our criteria as they streamline integration, improve maintainability, and enhance code quality.

# Internal Opinions and Feedback:
_Waiting for team members opinion about the proposed changes._

# External Opinions and Feedback:
_Waiting for external opinion about the proposed changes._

# How Did You Evaluate the Candidates?
We evaluated the candidates based on the criteria of efficiency, flexibility, maintainability, and collaborative potential. The proposed changes best align with these criteria.

Why Did You Choose the Winner?
We chose the proposed changes because they align with our objective of creating a single, easy-to-maintain database system that can seamlessly integrate multiple products.

What Is Happening Since Then?
The proposed changes are under consideration for implementation, with a focus on developing the "ailab-db" as the core database and creating a modular product integration system.

Knowing What You Know Now, What Would You Advise People to Do Differently?
We would advise others to consider the long-term benefits of restructuring their database systems to accommodate growth and product diversity, even if it requires initial changes and investments.

Recommendation:
We recommend implementing the proposed changes, including renaming the "louis-db" to "ailab-db" and revising the repository structure for seamless product integration. These changes align with our objective and are vital for efficiently managing databases for multiple products, streamlining deployment and maintenance processes, improving code quality, and facilitating collaboration among development teams.
