# Using Generative AI: High-Level Guidance

## Overview

Generative AI, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, utilizes advanced algorithms to
autonomously create content. It offers vast potential for enhancing government
operations. However, its use is not universally applicable and should be
restricted to instances where risks can be effectively managed, balancing
potential benefits with responsible use. Generative AI encompasses technologies
that can:

* Write and edit documents and emails
* Assist with coding tasks, such as debugging and generating templates
* Summarize information
* Aid in brainstorming sessions
* Conduct research and translation
* Facilitate learning
* Provide support to clients by answering questions and troubleshooting

## Challenges and Concerns

* Ethical, legal, and security considerations are paramount when deploying
  generative AI. Issues range from biased or inaccurate outputs to breaches of
  privacy and security protocols.
* Vigilance against potential misuse by threat actors is necessary to safeguard
  institutional integrity, with adherence to the Canadian Centre for Cyber
  Securityâ€™s guidelines.
* Generative AI must be used in compliance with strict privacy, security,
  intellectual property, and human rights regulations.
* Overreliance on AI can impede critical human judgment and skills, alongside
  environmental implications.
* Utmost caution is essential when integrating generative AI into
  decision-making processes to avoid undermining procedural fairness and
  accountability.

## Recommended Approach

* Begin with a Privacy Impact Assessment to gauge privacy concerns. Ensure
  protection of sensitive data and comprehension of the legal ramifications of
  AI outputs.
* Follow "FASTER" principles for responsible AI usage, and consult the ethical
  decision-making guide when evaluating AI tools, emphasizing their role as
  aides rather than replacements for employees.
* Tackle risks related to privacy, bias, and intellectual property diligently.
* Engage with legal, privacy, and security experts to address these issues and
  validate AI's alignment with user and organizational requirements.
* Use AI as a support mechanism; avoid delegating tasks to AI in areas lacking
  in-house expertise to maintain skill integrity within the organization.
