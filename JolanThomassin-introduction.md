**Hello !** ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jolan Thomassin**, an enthusiastic database manager at **CFIA/ACIA** (Canadian Inspection Food Agency). My role involves working with databases, and contributing to the efficient management of information.

My interest in IT dates back to my childhood and I have always enjoyed solving the different challenges that came my way. I particularly **like algorithms, artificial intelligence, robotics and the creation of video games**. I am a conscientious, perfectionist and attentive person, essential qualities to succeed in this field.

I like to do lots of different projects, which I list on [my website](https://jolanthomassin.fr). I hope to be able to continue working on many different things and to increase my programming  skills in the future.

I hope we can get along, and build the technological world of tomorrow !
